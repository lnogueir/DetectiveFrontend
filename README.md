#HTML Detective Frontend
##Introduction
This application was based on the projects created by Professor Sapienza from URFJ, I compiled most his proposed first year projects into one. Initially this was was a tkinter application, since this was the library proposed by the Prof, but I've created a new version using react native for the front end.
Besides that, I have also modified the way I store the data, instead of saving it as file system, I switched to database system for the backend. Code for the backend available [here]()
